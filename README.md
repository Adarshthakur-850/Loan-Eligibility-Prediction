# 🏦 Loan Eligibility Prediction System

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for approval based on financial and personal attributes.
This system helps financial institutions automate and improve loan approval decision-making.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval is a critical decision-making process in banks and financial institutions.
This project builds a predictive model using supervised machine learning techniques to classify applicants as:

* ✅ Eligible for Loan
* ❌ Not Eligible for Loan

The model is trained on structured applicant data including income, credit history, loan amount, and other relevant features.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Engineer meaningful features
* Train multiple classification models
* Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics
* Select the best-performing model for prediction

---

## 📊 Dataset Features

Typical features used in prediction:

* Gender
* Marital Status
* Dependents
* Education
* Self Employed
* Applicant Income
* Coapplicant Income
* Loan Amount
* Loan Amount Term
* Credit History
* Property Area

Target Variable:

* `Loan_Status` (Approved / Rejected)
